## NFIQ2-rs

NFIQ2-rs is a Rust library providing bindings for NIST's [NFIQ2](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/nfiq-2) fingerprint quality assessment tool, using UniFFI for cross-language interoperability. It allows developers to integrate NFIQ2 functionality into their applications with ease.
